# Stanford Machine Learning

The following notes represent a complete, stand alone interpretation of Stanford's machine learning course presented by [Professor Andrew Ng](http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/) and originally posted on the [ml-class.org](http://www.ml-class.org/course/class/index/) website during the fall 2011 semester. The topics covered are shown below, although for a more detailed summary see lecture 19\. The only content not covered here is the Octave/MATLAB programming.

All diagrams are my own or are directly taken from the lectures, full credit to Professor Ng for a truly exceptional lecture course.
